	involves the differentiation of naive cells into memory and effector

	CD7 identifies three populations of CD8 T cells: CD7 high (CD7(high)),

	effector cells. The effector cells can functionally be divided into
	cytokine-secreting effector CD8 T cells and lytic effector CD8 T

	its phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. We recently identified
	a protein kinase, termed PDK1, that phosphorylates PKB at Thr308
	only in the presence of lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol
	3,4,5-trisphosphate (Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3) or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate
	(Ptdlns(3,4)P2). RESULTS: We have cloned and sequenced human PDK1.
	The 556-residue monomeric enzyme comprises a catalytic domain that
	is most similar to the PKA, PKB and PKC subfamily of protein kinases
	and a carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The PDK1
	gene is located on human chromosome 16p13.3 and is expressed ubiquitously
	in human tissues. Human PDK1 is homologous to the Drosophila protein
	kinase DSTPK61, which has been implicated in the regulation of sex
	differentiation, oogenesis and spermatogenesis. Expressed PDK1 and
	DSTPK61 phosphorylated Thr308 of PKB alpha only in the presence of
	Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3 or Ptdlns(3,4)P2. Overexpression of PDK1 in 293 cells
	activated PKB alpha and potentiated the IGF1-induced phosphorylation
	of PKB alpha at Thr308. Experiments in which the PH domains of either
	PDK1 or PKB alpha were deleted indicated that the binding of Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3
	or Ptdlns(3,4)P2 to PKB alpha is required for phosphorylation and
	activation by PDK1. IGF1 stimulation of 293 cells did not affect
	the activity or phosphorylation of PDK1. CONCLUSIONS: PDK1 is likely
	to mediate the activation of PKB by insulin or growth factors. DSTPK61
	is a Drosophila homologue of PDK1. The effect of Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3/Ptdlns(3,4)P2

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein kinase B (PKB) is involved in the regulation of
	apoptosis, protein synthesis and glycogen metabolism in mammalian
	cells. Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK-1) activates
	PKB in a manner dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
	(PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), which is also needed for the translocation of
	PKB to the plasma membrane. It has been proposed that the amount
	of PKB activated is determined exclusively as a result of its translocation,
	and that a constitutively active pool of membrane-associated PDK-1
	simply phosphorylates all the PKB made available. Here, we have investigated
	the effects of membrane localisation of PDK-1 on PKB activation.
	RESULTS: Ectopically expressed PDK-1 translocated to the plasma membrane
	in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and translocation
	was sensitive to wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
	Translocation of PDK-1 also occurred upon its co-expression with
	constitutively active phosphoinositide 3-kinase, but not with an
	inactive form. Overexpression of PDK-1 enhanced the ability of PDGF
	to activate PKB. PDK-1 disrupted in the pleckstrin homology (PH)
	domain which did not translocate to the membrane did not increase
	PKB activity in response to PDGF, whereas membrane-targeted PDK-1
	activated PKB to the extent that it could not be activated further
	by PDGF. CONCLUSIONS: In response to PDGF, binding of Ptdlns (3,4,5)P3
	and/or Ptdlns(3,4)P2 to the PH domain of PDK-1 causes its translocation
	to the plasma membrane where it co-localises with PKB, significantly

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein kinase B (PKB) is involved in the regulation of
	apoptosis, protein synthesis and glycogen metabolism in mammalian
	cells. Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK-1) activates
	PKB in a manner dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
	(PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), which is also needed for the translocation of
	PKB to the plasma membrane. It has been proposed that the amount
	of PKB activated is determined exclusively as a result of its translocation,
	and that a constitutively active pool of membrane-associated PDK-1
	simply phosphorylates all the PKB made available. Here, we have investigated
	the effects of membrane localisation of PDK-1 on PKB activation.
	RESULTS: Ectopically expressed PDK-1 translocated to the plasma membrane
	in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and translocation
	was sensitive to wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
	Translocation of PDK-1 also occurred upon its co-expression with
	constitutively active phosphoinositide 3-kinase, but not with an
	inactive form. Overexpression of PDK-1 enhanced the ability of PDGF
	to activate PKB. PDK-1 disrupted in the pleckstrin homology (PH)
	domain which did not translocate to the membrane did not increase
	PKB activity in response to PDGF, whereas membrane-targeted PDK-1
	activated PKB to the extent that it could not be activated further
	by PDGF. CONCLUSIONS: In response to PDGF, binding of Ptdlns (3,4,5)P3
	and/or Ptdlns(3,4)P2 to the PH domain of PDK-1 causes its translocation
	to the plasma membrane where it co-localises with PKB, significantly
	contributing to the scale of PKB activation.},

	substrate)/Gab family of adapter proteins, undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation
	in response to cytokine or growth factor stimulation and serves as
	a docking platform for many signal transduction effectors, including
	the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 [SH2 (Src homology 2)-domain-containing
	tyrosine phosphatase]. Here, we report that, following IL-2 (interleukin-2)
	stimulation of human T lymphocytes, SHP-2 binds tyrosine residues
	614 and 643 of human Gab2 through its N- and C-terminal SH2 domains
	respectively. However, the sole mutation of Tyr-614 into phenylalanine
	is sufficient to prevent Gab2 from recruiting SHP-2. Expression of
	the Gab2 Tyr-614--\mbox{$<$}Phe (Y614F) mutant, defective in SHP-2
	association, prevents ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase)
	activation and expression of a luciferase reporter plasmid driven
	by the c-fos SRE (serum response element), indicating that interaction
	of SHP-2 with Gab2 is required for ERK activation in response to
	IL-2. Further investigation of IL-2-dependent induction of SRE showed
	that expression of a constitutively active mutant of the RhoA GTPase
	synergizes with IL-2 for SRE-driven transcription, whereas a dominant-negative
	mutant reduces the IL-2 response. Thus, in response to IL-2, full
	induction of the SRE requires ERK-dependent as well as Rho-dependent
	signals that target the Ets-box and the CArG-box respectively. We
	also report that the synergy between Gab2/SHP-2 and RhoA for IL-2-dependent
	CArG-box-driven transcription depends upon MEK (mitogen-activated
	protein kinase/ERK kinase) activation, and is likely to involve regulation
	of the serum response factor co-activator MAL. Our studies thus provide
	new insights into the role of Gab2 and SHP-2 in IL-2 signal transduction.},

	activation, which is accompanied by phosphorylation of regulatory
	sites in the HPK1 kinase activation loop. We show that full activation
	of HPK1 is dependent on autophosphorylation of threonine 165 and
	phosphorylation of serine 171, which is a target site for protein

  abstract = {T lymphocyte activation requires recognition of antigen by the antigen

	event results in the activation of non-TCR linked protein tyrosine
	kinases (PTKs). The mechanism of co-stimulation of T cells is unknown
	except for the involvement of PTKs. The T cell surface molecule CD28
	is effective in delivering co-stimulatory signals and prevents T
	cell anergy by inducing T cell proliferation in TCR stimulated T
	cells, primarily due to an increase in IL-2 production. The mechanism
	by which CD28 mediates this effect is currently unknown. Some conventional
	receptor molecules possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase and as a consequence
	of cross-linking or ligand binding, phosphorylate numerous tyrosines
	within their cytoplasmic tail, leading these tyrosines to become
	'activated' and bind cytoplasmic effector molecules possessing Src
	homology 2 domains which specifically recognize phosphorylated tyrosines.
	One such cytoplasmic effector molecule is the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate
	kinase (PI3 kinase) which recognizes the motif phosphotyrosine-methione/valine-X-methionine
	(X being any amino acid) within the cytoplasmic tails of numerous
	receptor tyrosine kinases. As CD28 contains a copy of the PI3 kinase
	binding motif within its cytoplasmic tail, we investigated CD28 signaling

	line that CD28 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following CD28 cross-linking

  abstract = {The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylates
	and activates a number of protein kinases of the AGC subfamily. The
	kinase domain of PDK1 interacts with a region of protein kinase C-related
	kinase-2 (PRK2), termed the PDK1-interacting fragment (PIF), through
	a hydrophobic motif. Here we identify a hydrophobic pocket in the
	small lobe of the PDK1 kinase domain, separate from the ATP- and
	substrate-binding sites, that interacts with PIF. Mutation of residues
	predicted to form part of this hydrophobic pocket either abolished
	or significantly diminished the affinity of PDK1 for PIF. PIF increased
	the rate at which PDK1 phosphorylated a synthetic dodecapeptide (T308tide),
	corresponding to the sequences surrounding the PDK1 phosphorylation
	site of PKB. This peptide is a poor substrate for PDK1, but a peptide
	comprising T308tide fused to the PDK1-binding motif of PIF was a
	vastly superior substrate for PDK1. Our results suggest that the
	PIF-binding pocket on the kinase domain of PDK1 acts as a 'docking
	site', enabling it to interact with and enhance the phosphorylation
	of its substrates.},

	are expressed. CD2 or CD28 stimulation, but not CD3/TCR stimulation,
	induces Dok phosphorylation. Recent evidence suggests that they act

	identify the molecular mechanisms involved in Dok-mediated inhibition,
	we have identified proteins that bind to the phosphotyrosine-binding
	(PTB) domain of Dok-1 and Dok-2. We showed that the Dok PTB domain
	mediates phosphotyrosine-dependent homotypic and heterotypic interactions
	of Dok-1 and Dok-2. Moreover, in CD2-stimulated Jurkat cells, Dok-1
	coimmunoprecipitates with tyrosine-phosphorylated Dok-2. To study
	the involvement of PTB-mediated oligomerization in Dok function,
	we have generated Jurkat clones overexpressing Dok-1 or Dok-2 with
	a mutation that prevents oligomerization (in either the PTB domain
	or Tyr146 of Dok-1 and Tyr139 of Dok-2). These mutations abrogate
	CD2-induced phosphorylation and the ability of Dok-1 or Dok-2 to
	inhibit CD2-induced ERK1/2 and NFAT activation. Moreover, overexpression
	of Dok-1Y146F or Dok-2Y139F interferes with CD2-induced phosphorylation
	of endogenous Dok, whereas overexpression of PTB mutant or wild-type
	Dok does not. Taken together, these data indicate that PTB-mediated
	oligomerization of Dok-1 and Dok-2 represents an essential step for

	specific expansion of two B cell subpopulations that express high

	inhibited in CD45-null animals at two distinct stages. The efficiency

	response to cross-linking signals via T cell receptor (TCR) in fetal
	thymic organ culture. In contrast, apoptosis can be induced normally
	in CD45-null thymocytes by non-TCR-mediated signals. Since both positive

	findings suggest that CD45 is an important regulator of signal transduction
	via the TCR complex at multiple stages of T cell development. CD45
	is absolutely required for the transmission of mitogenic signals

	B cells in response to CD38 cross-linking is significantly reduced

  abstract = {The functional activity of integrin receptors on T cells is dynamically
	regulated so that T cells can alternate rapidly between adhesive
	and nonadhesive states. The CD7 Ag is one of several molecules on
	T cells that can transduce intracellular signals that rapidly up-regulate
	integrin-mediated adhesion. We demonstrate in this report that the
	signaling pathway that CD7 utilizes to regulate integrin activity
	involves the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K).
	CD7 stimulation of both Jurkat T cells and resting human peripheral
	blood CD4+ T cells results in rapid association and activation of
	PI 3-K with CD7. Phosphopeptide competition assays demonstrate that
	the association of CD7 with PI 3-K is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation
	of the SH2 binding motif Tyr-Glu-Asp-Met (YEDM) in the CD7 cytoplasmic
	domain. A role for PI 3-K in the regulation of integrin function
	by CD7 is demonstrated by: 1) the ability of two structurally distinct
	PI 3-K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, to inhibit CD7-mediated
	increases in beta1 integrin function of human T cells; and 2) inhibition
	of CD7-mediated activation of beta3 integrin function in human T
	cells by expression of a dominant negative form of the p85 subunit
	of PI 3-K. These results demonstrate that the CD7 Ag on human T cells
	is coupled to PI 3-K and that this association is relevant to CD7-mediated
	signaling events, specifically CD7-induced increases in integrin
	adhesiveness. Furthermore, these studies provide important new evidence
	implicating PI 3-K in the regulation of integrin adhesiveness by
	multiple cell surface signaling receptors.},

	engagement of the CD7 antigen on human T cells results in an increase

	suggests that CD7 is capable of transducing intracellular signals,

	the intracellular mechanism by which CD7 modulates integrin functional

	found to be unique when compared to phorbol ester stimulation and
	CD3/T cell receptor cross-linking, based on differences in the kinetics
	of activation-dependent integrin-mediated adhesion and lack of increase
	in CD2 functional activity. Second, up-regulation of integrin activity
	mediated by CD7 cross-linking was completely inhibited by the tyrosine
	kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Third, antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting
	demonstrated that antibody engagement of CD7 results in a rapid but
	transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in human T cells.

	Etoposide activated NF-kB through PI3-kinase/Akt, and the transcription

  abstract = {By using ligands with various affinities for the T-cell receptor (TCR)
	and by altering the contribution of the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase,
	the effects of the potency of TCR-induced signals on the function
	of small GTPases Ras and Rap1 were studied. T cells expressing low-molecular-weight
	CD45 isoforms (e.g., CD45RO) exhibited the strongest activation of
	the Ras-dependent Elk-1 transcription factor and the highest sensitivity
	to the inhibitory action of dominant negative mutant Ras compared
	to T cells expressing high-molecular-weight CD45 isoforms (ABC).
	Moreover, stimulation of CD45RO(+), but not CD45ABC(+), T cells with
	a high-affinity TCR ligand induced suboptimal Elk-1 activation compared
	with the stimulation induced by an intermediate-affinity TCR-ligand
	interaction. This observation suggested that the Ras-dependent signaling
	pathway is safeguarded in CD45RO(+) expressors by a negative regulatory
	mechanism(s) which prohibits maximal activation of the Ras-dependent
	signaling events following high-avidity TCR-ligand engagement. Interestingly,
	the biochemical activity of another small GTPase, the Ras-like protein
	Rap1, which has been implicated in the functional suppression of
	Ras signaling, was inversely correlated with the extent of Elk-1
	activation induced by different-affinity TCR ligands. Consistently,
	overexpression of putative Rap dominant negative mutant RapN17 or
	the physiologic inhibitor of Rap1, the Rap GTPase-activating protein
	RapGAP, augmented the Elk-1 response in CD45RO(+) T cells. This is
	in contrast to the suppressive effect of RapN17 and RapGAP on CD45ABC(+)
	T cells, underscoring the possibility that Rap1 can act as either
	a repressor or a potentiator of Ras effector signals, depending on
	CD45 isoform expression. These observations suggest that cells expressing
	distinct isoforms of CD45 employ different signal transduction schemes
	to optimize Ras-mediated signal transduction in activated T lymphocytes.},

  abstract = {The CD45 tyrosine phosphatase has been reported to activate the src
	family tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn by dephosphorylating regulatory
	COOH-terminal tyrosine residues 505 and 528, respectively. However,
	recent studies with CD45- T-cell lines have found that despite the
	fact that Lck and Fyn were constitutively hyperphosphorylated, the
	tyrosine kinase activity of both enzymes was actually increased.
	In the present study, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the
	increased phosphorylation of Lck in CD45- YAC-1 T cells was restricted
	to tyrosine residues. To understand the relationship between tyrosine
	phosphorylation and Lck kinase activity, CD45- YAC-1 cells were transfected
	with forms of Lck in which tyrosines whose phosphorylation is thought
	to regulate enzyme activity (Tyr-192, Tyr-394, Tyr-505, or both Tyr-394
	and Tyr-505) were replaced with phenylalanine. While the Y-to-F mutation
	at position 192 (192-Y-->F) had little effect, the 505-Y-->F mutation
	increased enzymatic activity. In contrast, the 394-Y-->F mutation
	decreased the kinase activity to very low levels, an effect that
	the double mutation, 394-Y-->F and 505Y-->F, could not reverse. Phosphopeptide
	analysis of tryptic digests of Lck from CD45- YAC-1 cells revealed
	that it is hyperphosphorylated on two tyrosine residues, Tyr-505
	and, to a lesser extent, Tyr-394. The purified and enzymatically
	active intracellular portion of CD45 dephosphorylated Lck Tyr-394
	in vitro. These results demonstrate that in addition to Tyr-505,
	CD45 can dephosphorylate Tyr-394, and that in the absence of CD45
	the hyperphosphorylation of Tyr-394 can cause an increase in the
	kinase activity of Lck despite the inhibitory hyperphosphorylation
	of Tyr-505. Therefore, Lck kinase activity is determined by the balance
	of activating and inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylations that are,
	in turn, regulated by CD45.},

	is an intriguing puzzle. Understanding how specificity is achieved

  abstract = {The major host response to many viral infections is the generation
	of virus-specific CTL. Many protein molecules on the surfaces of
	both CTL and target cells interact to mediate adhesion of the cells
	and generate signals that lead to T cell activation and proliferation
	of virus-specific CTL that then mediate lysis of infected cells.
	One such protein, CD2, has been shown to increase the binding affinity
	of CTL to infected cells, and, in addition, enhance CTL activation
	signals. To determine whether virus-specific CTL could be generated
	in the absence of CD2, mice lacking a functional CD2 gene were infected
	with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and the responses
	to the virus were monitored. CD2-deficient mice infected intracerebrally
	with LCMV died as a consequence of CTL-mediated choriomeningitis,
	similar to control littermates. Additionally, CD2-deficient mice
	inoculated i.p. with LCMV cleared the infection by 2 wk postinfection,
	as did control mice. Viral clearance in these mice was shown to be
	due to the generation of a vigorous virus-specific MHC-restricted
	CTL response. Finally, to determine whether CD2 is essential for
	the generation of memory CTL, we examined the ability of CD2-deficient
	mice to generate memory CTL to LCMV and found normal memory CTL responses.
	Our results indicate that CD2 is not required for the generation
	of an LCMV-specific CTL response in vivo, nor is CD2 required for
	the maintenance or activation of memory CTL.},

	exclusively in nucleated hematopoietic cells. The Src family kinase,
	Lck, is a major CD45 substrate in T cells and CD45 dephosphorylation
	of Lck is important for both T cell development and activation. However,
	how the substrate specificity of phosphatases such as CD45 is achieved
	is not well understood. Analysis of the interaction between the cytoplasmic
	domain of CD45 and its substrate, Lck, revealed that the active,
	membrane-proximal phosphatase domain of CD45 (CD45-D1) bound to the
	phosphorylated Lck kinase domain, the SH2 domain, and the unique
	N-terminal region of Lck. The second, inactive phosphatase domain
	(CD45-D2) bound only to the kinase domain of Lck. CD45-D2 was unable
	to bind phosphotyrosine, and its interaction with the kinase domain
	of Lck was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. The binding of
	CD45-D2 was localized to subdomain X (SD10) of Lck. CD45-D2 bound
	similarly to Src family kinases but bound Csk to a lesser extent
	and did not bind significantly to the less related kinase, Erk1.
	CD45 dephosphorylated Lck and Src at similar rates but dephosphorylated
	Csk and Erk1 at lower rates. Replacement of Erk1 SD10 with that of
	Lck resulted in the binding of CD45-D2 and the conversion of Erk1
	to a more efficient CD45 substrate. This demonstrates a role for
	CD45-D2 in binding substrate and identifies the SD10 region in Lck
	as a novel site involved in substrate recognition.},

	protein kinase 1 (PDK1) in protein kinase B (PKB) activation and
	translocation to the cell surface. Wild-type and PDK1 mutants were
	transfected into HeLa cells, and their subcellular localization was
	analyzed. PDK1 was found to translocate to the plasma membrane in
	response to insulin, and this process did not require a functional
	catalytic activity, since a catalytically inactive kinase mutant
	(Kd) of PDK1 was capable of translocating. The PDK1 presence at the
	cell surface was shown to be linked to phospholipids and therefore
	to serum-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Using
	confocal microscopy in HeLa cells we found that PDK1 colocalizes
	with PKB at the plasma membrane. Further, after cotransfection of
	PKB and a PDK1 mutant (Mut) unable to translocate to the plasma membrane,
	PKB was prevented from moving to the cell periphery after insulin
	stimulation. In response to insulin, a PKB mutant with its PH domain
	deleted (DeltaPH-PKB) retained the ability to translocate to the
	plasma membrane when coexpressed with PDK1. Finally, we found that
	DeltaPH-PKB was highly active independent of insulin stimulation
	when cotransfected with PDK1 mutants defective in their PH domain.
	These findings suggest that PDK1 brings PKB to the plasma membrane
	upon exposure of cells to insulin and that the PH domain of PDK1
	acts as a negative regulator of its enzyme activity.},

  abstract = {In this report we investigated the function of phosphoinositide-dependent
	protein kinase 1 (PDK1) in protein kinase B (PKB) activation and
	translocation to the cell surface. Wild-type and PDK1 mutants were
	transfected into HeLa cells, and their subcellular localization was
	analyzed. PDK1 was found to translocate to the plasma membrane in
	response to insulin, and this process did not require a functional
	catalytic activity, since a catalytically inactive kinase mutant
	(Kd) of PDK1 was capable of translocating. The PDK1 presence at the
	cell surface was shown to be linked to phospholipids and therefore
	to serum-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. Using
	confocal microscopy in HeLa cells we found that PDK1 colocalizes
	with PKB at the plasma membrane. Further, after cotransfection of
	PKB and a PDK1 mutant (Mut) unable to translocate to the plasma membrane,
	PKB was prevented from moving to the cell periphery after insulin
	stimulation. In response to insulin, a PKB mutant with its PH domain
	deleted (DeltaPH-PKB) retained the ability to translocate to the
	plasma membrane when coexpressed with PDK1. Finally, we found that
	DeltaPH-PKB was highly active independent of insulin stimulation
	when cotransfected with PDK1 mutants defective in their PH domain.
	These findings suggest that PDK1 brings PKB to the plasma membrane
	upon exposure of cells to insulin and that the PH domain of PDK1
	acts as a negative regulator of its enzyme activity.},

	This report investigates signalling mechanisms involved in the production

	by macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and co-cultured with

	or of rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6-kinase (p70S6K). Spontaneous
	IL-10 production by rheumatoid arthritis synovial-membrane mononuclear
	cells (RA-SMCs) and co-cultures of rheumatoid arthritis T cells (RA-Ts)
	and macrophages was also assessed. RA-T and Tck induction of macrophage
	IL-10 production was suppressed by cell separation and inhibition
	of PI3K and p70S6K. PI3K involvement was also shown by phosphorylation
	of the downstream effector protein kinase B. Spontaneous IL-10 production
	by RA-SMCs was also inhibited by LY294002 and depletion of the nonadherent
	(T-cell-enriched) fraction of the cell population. IL-10 production
	in RA-SMCs and M-CSF-primed macrophages, activated by interaction
	with Tck, is PI3K- and p70S6K-dependent.},

	plays an essential role in T-cell activation by activating the Lck

	have indicated that CD45 may have both stimulatory and inhibitory
	roles in T-cell activation. Thus, it is unlikely that the two kinases
	are the sole substrates of the CD45 PTPase. Furthermore, the complex
	regulation of the alternative splicing of the extracellular domain

	the CD45 PTPase. To identify such functions, it is necessary to identify
	physiologically relevant substrates of the CD45 PTPase other than
	the two protein-tyrosine kinases. To this end, we searched for high-affinity
	substrates of the CD45 PTPase among the tyrosine-phosphorylated T-cell
	proteins by using purified glutathione S-transferase-CD45 fusion
	molecules. The enzymatically inactive CD45 C828S mutant protein,

	PTPases bound the phosphorylated CD3 zeta chain. Furthermore, phosphorylated
	CD3 zeta chain was preferentially dephosphorylated by the wild-type

	The biochemical basis of these co-stimulatory signals are still poorly

	pathways such as tyrosine phosphorylation, phospholipase C, sphingomyelinase

	that CD28-B7.1 and B7.2 interaction could be involved in the production

	basis for these different functions is still unknown. We have analyzed
	the functional and molecular consequences of CD28 activation by B7.1

	CD28 and does not require pre-activation by CD3-T cell receptor.

	stimulation through the TCR and costimulatory receptors such as CD28.
	Following initial activation, secondary receptors are up-regulated
	that can costimulate T cells in concert with TCR engagement. One
	such receptor is the TNFR family member CD30. In this study, we report
	that unlike CD28, ligation of CD30 on normal effector T cells induces
	IL-13 production in the absence of concurrent TCR engagement. TCR-independent
	CD30-mediated IL-13 release correlated with activation of c-Jun N-terminal
	kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NF-kappaB,
	and was completely inhibited by the expression of a TNFR-associated
	factor 2 (TRAF2) dominant-negative transgene (TRAF2.DN-Tg), but not
	by that of an I-kappaBalpha dominant-negative transgene. In parallel,
	expression of the TRAF2.DN-Tg selectively prevented the induction
	of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK, but not that of NF-kappaB.
	Furthermore, IL-13 production was reduced in a dose-dependent manner
	by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Together, these results suggest
	that TCR-independent CD30-mediated production of IL-13 is triggered
	by association of CD30 with TRAF family members and subsequent activation
	of p38 MAPK. Inasmuch as IL-13 can promote airway inflammation and
	cancer progression, production of IL-13 in a TCR-independent manner
	has important pathological implications in vivo.},

	based upon the differential membrane compartmentalization on the
	T cell surface. To test the importance of CD45 exclusion from lipid
	microdomains for proper TCR signaling, a chimeric molecule was generated
	by fusing the CD45 cytoplasmic region, which contains the PTP domains,
	to the amino-terminal 12 amino acids of Lck, which target Lck to
	lipid microdomains. Using 3A9 T lymphocyte hybridoma (3A9H) cells

  abstract = {Regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical control point
	for integration of environmental signals into cellular responses.
	This regulation is mediated by the reciprocal actions of protein
	tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. CD45, the first and prototypic
	receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed on all nucleated
	hematopoietic cells and plays a central role in this process. Studies
	of CD45 mutant cell lines, CD45-deficient mice, and CD45-deficient
	humans initially demonstrated the essential role of CD45 in antigen
	receptor signal transduction and lymphocyte development. It is now
	known that CD45 also modulates signals emanating from integrin and
	cytokine receptors. Recent work has focused on regulation of CD45
	expression and alternative splicing, isoform-specific differences
	in signal transduction, and regulation of phosphatase activity. From
	these studies, a model is emerging in which CD45 affects cellular
	responses by controlling the relative threshold of sensitivity to
	external stimuli. Perturbation of this function may contribute to
	autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and malignancy. Moreover, recent
	advances suggest that modulation of CD45 function can have therapeutic
	benefit in many disease states.},

	demonstrates that membrane localization of Sos is sufficient for

	activation of a large multisubunit kinase complex, IKK, which phosphorylates
	IkappaB. IkappaB is subsequently degraded, releasing NFkappaB, which
	translocates to the nucleus. We previously reported that inhibitors
	of the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) prevent phorbol ester-induced
	phosphorylation of IkappaB. Here we show that KN93, an inhibitor
	of CaM-dependent kinases (CaMKs), also inhibits the phosphorylation
	of IkappaB. The effect of both CaM and CaMK inhibitors on IkappaB
	phosphorylation is due to the inhibition of the activity of CaMK
	II because neither drug has any effect when a derivative of CaMK
	II that is insensitive to these inhibitors is expressed. When CaMK
	II is inhibited, phorbol ester is no longer able to activate IKK,
	placing CaMK II in the signaling pathway that leads to IKK activation.
	CaM and CaMK inhibitors also block T cell receptor/CD3-induced activation
	but have no effect on the ability of the cytokine tumor necrosis
	factor alpha or the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A to induce degradation
	of IkappaB. Finally we show that expression of a constitutively active
	CaMK II results in the activation of NFkappaB. The results identify
	CaMK II as a mediator of IKK activation specifically in response
	to T cell receptor/CD3 and phorbol ester stimulation.},

	of mutagen, (approximately 15 mM ethylmethane sulfate; EMS), were
	used so as to limit the occurrence of second-site mutations, thus
	increasing the probability of recovering single nucleotide substitutions.
	Treatment of over 32,400 marked chromosomes resulted in 486 analyzed
	mutations. In this paper, we add 133 previously unidentified let
	genes, isolated in the EMS screens, and one let gene identified by
	a gamma-ray induced mutation, to our collection of 103 essential

	mutants already existed. In total, eight deficiencies and alleles
	of 237 essential genes were identified. Eighty-nine of the previously
	unidentified let genes are represented by more than one lethal allele.
	Statistical analysis indicates a minimum estimate of 400 essential
	genes in the region of chromosome I balanced by sDp2. This region
	occupies approximately half of chromosome I, and contains over 1135
	protein-coding genes predicted from the genomic sequence data. Thus,
	approximately one-third of the predicted genes are estimated to be
	essential. Of these approximately 60\% are represented by lethal
	alleles. Less than 2\% of the lethal-bearing strains recovered in

	carried more than one lethal mutation. Several screens were used
	to recover mutations for this analysis. Because all the mutations
	were isolated using the same balancer, under similar screening conditions,
	it was possible to compare intervals within the sDp2 region with

	a function of cell division and in a fashion that was influenced
	by polarizing cytokines. The Th2-associated chemoattractant receptors

	the Th1-associated receptors CXCR3 and CXCR6, consistent with a different

  abstract = {CD7 is a T cell-associated antigen which appears early in ontogeny
	and persists on circulating T cells. It appears to have a significant
	role in T cell development and function. The precise mechanism by
	which this molecule mediates its effect is not known. In this paper,
	we expressed the extracellular domain of CD7 in the baculovirus system
	and used this product to study the function CD7 might have in T cell
	activation. The recombinant protein was found to be structurally
	similar to the native CD7 and recognized by monoclonal and polyclonal
	antibodies to CD7. This protein inhibited T cell proliferation induced
	by anti-CD3/anti-CD7 costimulation. It also inhibited the augmentation
	effect of anti-CD7 on suboptimal PHA stimulation. However, it did
	not block T cell proliferation induced by optimal doses of PHA, staphylococcal
	entertoxin A or B. Interestingly, the recombinant protein inhibited
	antigenic- and alloantigenic-induced T cell proliferation. The latter
	finding strongly suggests that a ligand for CD7 exists and crosslinking
	CD7 by this ligand may be responsible for the costimulatory role
	it plays in T cell activation.},

	TCR/CD28 costimulation enhanced this association and stimulated the

	SPAK activation, required the PKCtheta-interacting region of SPAK,

	and activates members of the AGC protein kinase family and plays
	an important role in the regulation of cell survival, differentiation,
	and proliferation. However, how PDK-1 is regulated in cells remains
	elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that PDK-1 can shuttle between
	the cytoplasm and nucleus. Treatment of cells with leptomycin B,
	a nuclear export inhibitor, results in a nuclear accumulation of
	PDK-1. PDK-1 nuclear localization is increased by insulin, and this
	process is inhibited by pretreatment of cells with phosphatidylinositol
	3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitors. Consistent with the idea that PDK-1
	nuclear translocation is regulated by the PI3-kinase signaling pathway,
	PDK-1 nuclear localization is increased in cells deficient of PTEN
	(phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10). Deletion
	mapping and mutagenesis studies unveiled that presence of a functional
	nuclear export signal (NES) in mouse PDK-1 located at amino acid
	residues 382 to 391. Overexpression of constitutively nuclear PDK-1,
	which retained autophosphorylation at Ser-244 in the activation loop
	in cells and its kinase activity in vitro, led to increased phosphorylation
	of the predominantly nuclear PDK-1 substrate p70 S6KbetaI. However,
	the ability of constitutively nuclear PDK-1 to induce anchorage-independent
	growth and to protect against UV-induced apoptosis is greatly diminished
	compared with the wild-type enzyme. Taken together, these findings
	suggest that nuclear translocation may be a mechanism to sequestrate
	PDK-1 from activation of the cytosolic signaling pathways and that
	this process may play an important role in regulating PDK-1-mediated
	cell signaling and function.},

  abstract = {At least two distinct recurrent chromosomal translocations have been
	implicated in the pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma. The first, t(1;14),
	results in the transfer of the entire Bcl10 gene to chromosome 14
	wherein Bcl10 expression is inappropriately stimulated by the neighboring
	Ig enhancer. The second, t(11;18), results in the synthesis of a
	novel fusion protein, API2-MALT1. Until now, no common mechanism
	of action has been proposed to explain how the products of these
	seemingly unrelated translocations may contribute to the same malignant
	process. We show here that Bcl10 and MALT1 form a strong and specific
	complex within the cell, and that these proteins synergize in the
	activation of NF-kappaB. The data support a mechanism of action whereby
	Bcl10 mediates the oligomerization and activation of the MALT1 caspase-like
	domain. This subsequently activates the IKK complex through an unknown
	mechanism, setting in motion a cascade of events leading to NF-kappaB
	induction. Furthermore, the API2-MALT1 fusion protein also strongly
	activates NF-kappaB and shows dependence upon the same downstream
	signaling factors. We propose a model whereby both the Bcl10.MALT1
	complex and the API2-MALT1 fusion protein activate a common downstream
	signaling pathway that originates with the oligomerization-dependent
	activation of the MALT1 caspase-like domain.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: T lymphocytes can be activated by soluble factors such
	as cytokines or through direct cell-cell interactions. Although cytokine
	receptors are known to signal through STAT family transcription factors,
	the mechanisms by which other cell-surface molecules, such as CD2,
	transduce signals is unclear. The goal of this study was to determine
	whether stimulation of T cells through CD2 recapitulates aspects
	of cytokine-induced T-cell activation by use of STAT transcription
	factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T cells were treated with anti-CD2
	antibodies or cells bearing the natural CD2 ligand CD58, after which
	signaling through STAT transcription factors was assessed. RESULTS:
	Stimulation of CD2 on primary T lymphocytes leads to the tyrosine
	phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of STAT1.
	In contrast to stimulation by cytokines, the activation of STAT1
	in response to CD2 ligation is delayed and does not involve Jak kinases.
	Furthermore, while STAT phosphorylation induced by cytokines is generally
	transient, STAT1 phosphorylation following CD2 stimulation persists
	for a period of days. Transcription of key target genes such as IRF1
	and c-fos proceeds with delayed kinetics following CD2 stimulation,
	suggesting that this unique pattern of STAT activation may lead to
	a distinct cellular response following CD2 ligation. This pathway
	appears to be restricted to T cells, as stimulation of CD2 on NK
	cells does not lead to STAT1 activation. CONCLUSION: Stimulation
	of T cells through cell-surface molecules such as CD2 involves activation
	of STAT transcription factors, thus recapitulating elements of cytokine
	signaling.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The T-lymphocyte cell-surface molecule, CD2, was the first
	heterophilic cell-adhesion molecule to be discovered and has become
	an important paradigm for understanding the structural basis of cell
	adhesion. Interaction of CD2 with its ligands. CD58 (in humans) and
	CD48 (in mice and rats), contributes to antigen recognition by T
	cells. CD2, CD48 and CD58 are closely related members of the immunoglobulin
	superfamily and their extracellular regions are predicted to have
	very similar structures. The three-dimensional crystal structure
	of this region of CD2 has been determined, revealing two immunoglobulin
	domains with the ligand-binding site situated on an exposed beta
	sheet in the membrane-distal domain. This GFCC'C" beta sheet is also
	involved in a homophilic 'head-to-head' interaction in the CD2 crystal
	lattice, which has been proposed to be a model for the interactions
	of CD2 with its ligands. RESULTS: We show that the CD2-binding site
	on rat CD48 lies on the equivalent beta-sheet of its membrane-distal
	immunoglobulin domain. By making complementary mutations, we have
	shown that two charged residues in the CD48 ligand-binding site interact
	directly with two oppositely charged residues in CD2's ligand-binding
	site. These results indicate that the amino-terminal immunoglobulin
	domains of CD2 and CD48 bind each other in the same orientation as
	the CD2-CD2 crystal lattice interaction, strongly supporting the
	suggestion that CD2 interacts head-to-head with its ligand. Modelling
	CD48 onto the CD2 structure reveals that the CD2-CD48 complex spans
	approximately the same distance (134 A) as predicted for the complex
	between the T-cell receptor and the peptide-bound major histocompatibility
	complex (MHC) molecule. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, together with recent
	structural studies of CD2, provide the first indication of the specific
	topology of a cell-adhesion molecule complex. The similar dimensions
	predicted for the CD2-CD48 complex and the complex between the T-cell
	receptor and the peptide-bound MHC molecule suggest that one of the
	functions of CD2 may be to position the plasma membranes of the T
	cell and the antigen-presenting (or target) cell at the optimal distance
	for the low-affinity interaction between the T-cell receptor and
	the peptide-bound MHC molecule.},

	Degradation or release of LIGHT by matrix metalloproteinases then

	receptors from activating trimeric G proteins in the Gi subfamily.
	In HEK293 cells expressing recombinant receptors, directional migration
	toward appropriate agonist ligands requires release of free G protein
	[beta][gamma] subunits and can be triggered by agonists for receptors
	coupled to Gi but not by agonists for receptors coupled to two other
	G proteins, Gs and Gq. Because activation of any G protein presumably
	releases free G[beta][gamma], we tested the hypothesis that chemotaxis

	HEK293 cells were stably cotransfected with the Gi-coupled receptor
	for interleukin-8, CXCR1, and with a chimeric G[alpha], G[alpha]qz5,
	which resembles G[alpha]i in susceptibility to activation by Gi-coupled
	receptors but cannot regulate the G[alpha]i effector, adenylyl cyclase.
	These cells, unlike cells expressing CXCR1 alone, migrated toward
	interleukin-8 even after treatment with pertussis toxin, which prevents
	activation of endogenous G[alpha]i but not that of G[alpha]qz5. We
	infer that chemotaxis does not require activation of G[alpha]i. Because
	chemotaxis is mediated by G[beta][gamma] subunits released when Gi-coupled
	receptors activate G[alpha]qz5, but not when Gq- or Gs-coupled receptors
	activate their respective G proteins, we propose that Gi-coupled

	PDK1 has been reported to be constitutively active in resting cells

	A., Morrice, N. A., and Alessi, D. R. (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 287-292).
	Here, we report that PDK1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocates
	to the plasma membrane in response to pervanadate and insulin. Following
	pervanadate treatment, PDK1 kinase activity increased 1.5- to 3-fold
	whereas the activity of PDK1 associated with the plasma membrane
	increased approximately 6-fold. The activity of PDK1 localized to
	the plasma membrane was also increased by insulin treatment. Three
	tyrosine phosphorylation sites of PDK1 (Tyr-9 and Tyr-373/376) were

	mutants, we show that, although phosphorylation on Tyr-373/376 is
	important for PDK1 activity, phosphorylation on Tyr-9 has no effect
	on the activity of the kinase. Both of these residues can be phosphorylated
	by v-Src tyrosine kinase in vitro, and co-expression of v-Src leads
	to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PDK1. Thus, these data
	suggest that PDK1 activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation,
	possibly by a member of the Src kinase family.},

	IgM. Binding of IgM to the FcR for IgM (Fc mu R) on human NK cells
	was not species specific because mouse myeloma IgM also bound to
	these cells. The percentage of CD56+ cells binding IgM after incubation
	with anti-CD16 mAb was similar to that of cells incubated with medium
	alone (95 +/- 1\% vs 93 +/- 4\%). Binding of anti-CD16 mAb to Fc
	gamma RIII on NK cells was unaffected by pretreatment with IgM (65
	+/- 12\% vs 69 +/- 4\%). The CD7 molecule has been reported to be
	the Fc mu R on the surface of T cells. Two-color flow cytometry showed
	that 94 +/- 3\% of CD3-CD56+ resting NK cells and 71 +/- 16\% of
	activated NK cells were CD7+. Preincubation of NK cells with three
	anti-CD7 mAb (Leu-9, 8H8-1, and LAU-A1) failed to block the binding
	of IgM to the Fc mu R. Modulation of the CD7 molecule off the cell
	surface (CD7+ = 1.5\% +/- 0.3) did not reduce IgM binding, thus excluding
	the possibility that IgM anti-CD7 might bind to different epitopes
	of the same molecule. These data indicate that the Fc mu R is a specific
	Ig-binding structure, distinct from the Fc gamma RIII (CD16) or CD7.
	The Fc mu R on NK cells functions as a signal-transducing molecule
	because the addition of 0.2 mg/ml IgM to R-NK cells caused a rapid
	increase in [Ca2+]i (delta = 40 nM). One of the early events that
	followed signaling through the Fc mu R was the down-modulation of
	IFN-gamma gene expression and IFN gamma production in NK cells. The
	presence of IgM during culture of NK cells consistently decreased
	the expression of HLA-DR (16\% vs 40\% in control). Thus, the Fc

	to be an important functional molecule, which delivers negative regulatory

	activation of interleukin (IL)-2 promoter and nuclear factor of activated
	T cells (NFAT) element. Engagement of TCR induces tyrosine phosphorylation

	reveal that substitution of 3BP2-Tyr(183), Tyr(446), or Arg(486)
	in the SH2 domain suppresses TCR-mediated activation of NFAT. Point
	mutations of 3BP2 cannot affect the translocation of 3BP2 into the

	with Vav1, the guanine nucleotide exchanging factor of Rac1. In fact,
	overexpression of dominant-negative form of Rac1 inhibits TCR-mediated
	activation of NFAT. Phosphorylation of Tyr(446) recruits the SH2
	domain of Lck for the optimal activation of transcription factors.
	Furthermore, point mutation of Arg(486) in the 3BP2-SH2 domain that

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adhesion of leukocytes to the extracellular matrix and
	to other cells is mediated by members of the integrin family of adhesion
	molecules. Src family kinases are activated upon integrin-mediated
	adhesion. In lymphocytes, CD45 is a leukocyte-specific transmembrane
	protein tyrosine phosphatase that activates Src family kinases associated
	with B-cell and T-cell antigen receptor signaling by constitutive
	dephosphorylation of the inhibitory carboxy-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation
	site. Here, we show that CD45 is also important in downregulating
	the kinase activity of Src family members during integrin-mediated
	adhesion in macrophages. RESULTS: We found that CD45 colocalized
	with beta2 integrin and the Src family kinase p53/56(lyn) to adhesion
	sites in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Macrophages from CD45(-/-)
	mice were unable to maintain integrin-mediated adhesion. In adherent
	macrophages, absence of CD45 led to the hyperphosphorylation and
	hyperactivation of p56/59(hck) and p53/56(lyn), but not of p58(c-fgr).
	CD45 directly inactivated p59(hck) but not p56(lck) in transient
	transfection assays. Furthermore, coexpression of CD45 with p59(hck)
	or p56(lyn) containing a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at the
	carboxy-terminal negative regulatory site resulted in decreased tyrosine
	phosphorylation of the Src family member kinases due to dephosphorylation
	of the potentiating tyrosine phosphorylation site within the kinase
	domain. CONCLUSIONS: Using primary bone marrow macrophages, these
	studies demonstrate that CD45 regulates Src family kinases and is
	required to maintain macrophage adhesion. CD45 decreases Src family
	kinase activity by dephosphorylating the tyrosine residue located
	within the kinase domain.},

	can be activated by two Ras exchange factors, SOS and RasGRP1, which
	are recruited through the adapters Grb2 and LAT and via the second-messenger
	diacylglycerol (DAG), respectively. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
	kinase phosphorylation patterns induced by active Ras can vary and
	contribute to distinct cellular responses. The different consequences
	of Ras activation by either guanine exchange factor are unknown.
	DAG also recruits and activates the kinase protein kinase Ctheta
	(PKCtheta) turning on the Erk MAP kinase pathway, but the biochemical
	mechanism responsible is unclear. We generated T-cell clones deficient
	in phorbol myristate acetate (a surrogate for DAG)-induced Ras activation.
	Analysis of a RasGRP1-deficient Jurkat T-cell clone and RasGRP1 RNA
	interference in wild-type cells revealed that RasGRP1 is required
	for optimal, antigen receptor-triggered Ras-Erk activation. RasGRP1
	relies on its DAG-binding domain to selectively activate Erk kinases.
	Activation of Erk correlates with the phosphorylation of threonine
	residue 184 in RasGRP1. This phosphorylation event requires the activities
	of novel PKC kinases. Conversely, active PKCtheta depends on RasGRP1
	sufficiency to effectively trigger downstream events. Last, DAG-PKC-RasGRP1-driven
	Ras-Erk activation in T cells is a unique signaling event, not simply
	compensated for by SOS activity.},

	This switch in chemokine receptor usage leads to the acquisition

	report that PDK1 promotes MAPK activation in a MEK-dependent manner.
	In vitro kinase assay revealed that the direct targets of PDK1 in
	the MAPK pathway were the upstream MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. The
	identified PDK1 phosphorylation sites in MEK1 and MEK2 are Ser222
	and Ser226, respectively, and are known to be essential for full
	activation. To date, these sites are thought to be phosphorylated
	by Raf kinases. However, PDK1 gene silencing using small interference
	RNA demonstrates that PDK1 is associated with maintaining the steady-state
	phosphorylated MEK level and cell growth. The small interference
	RNA-mediated down-regulation of PDK1 attenuated maximum MEK and MAPK
	activities but could not prolong MAPK signaling duration. Stable
	and transient expression of constitutively active MEK1 overcame these

	a sustained increase in c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, suggesting
	that JNK activation contributes to the HPK1-mediated apoptosis in
	H2O2-treated EL-4 cells. Under the same conditions, a rapid cleavage
	of HPK1 was observed, and overexpression of N- and C-terminal cleavage
	products in CD4(+) T cells resulted in, similar to full-length HPK1,
	an increase in apoptosis. In agreement with published data, we show

	suggest that by inhibiting the antiapoptotic action of NF-kappaB

	cells. Of note, this effect was strictly dependent on the presence

	cell-surface glycoproteins. The first of these sialoglycoproteins
	to be identified was the receptor-linked phosphotyrosine phosphatase
	CD45, which is required for antigen/CD3-induced T-cell activation.
	In the present work, we examine the effect of interaction between
	the extracellular domain of CD45 and CD22 on T-cell activation. Using
	soluble CD22-immunoglobulin fusion proteins and T cells expressing
	wild-type and chimeric CD45 forms, we show that engagement of CD45
	by soluble CD22 can modulate early T-cell signals in antigen receptor/CD3-mediated
	stimulation. We also show that addition of sialic acid by beta-galactoside
	alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase to the CD22 molecule abrogates interactions
	between CD22 and its ligands. Together, these observations provide
	direct evidence for a functional role of the interaction between

	Ag receptor signal transduction in lymphocytes. Recently, a role
	for CD45 in the regulation of macrophage adhesion has been demonstrated
	as well. To investigate further the role of CD45 in the regulation
	of adhesion, we examined integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin
	of two T cell lines and their CD45-deficient variants. The absence
	of CD45 correlated with enhanced adhesion to fibronectin via integrin
	alpha5beta1 (VLA-5), but not alpha4beta1 (VLA-4) in both cell lines.
	Adhesion returned to normal levels upon transfection of wild-type
	CD45 into the CD45-deficient lines. Transfection of chimeric or mutant
	molecules expressing some, but not all, CD45 domains and activities
	demonstrated that both the transmembrane domain and the tyrosine
	phosphatase activity of CD45 were required for regulation of integrin-dependent
	adhesion, but the highly glycosylated extracellular domain was dispensable.
	In contrast, only a catalytically active CD45 cytoplasmic domain
	was required for TCR signaling. Transfectants that restored normal
	levels of adhesion to fibronectin coimmunoprecipitated with the transmembrane
	protein known as CD45-associated protein. These studies demonstrate
	a novel role for CD45 in adhesion regulation and suggest a possible

	In this report, we detected low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation
	of Shc and induced association with GRB2 upon T-cell receptor (TCR)
	stimulation. Instead, a prominent 36- to 38-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein
	(pp36-38) associated with the SH2 domain of GRB2 and formed a stable
	complex with GRB2/SOS upon TCR stimulation. Cellular fractionation
	studies showed that whereas both GRB2 and SOS partitioned to the
	soluble and particulate fractions, pp36-38 was present exclusively
	in the particulate fraction. This phosphoprotein had the same apparent
	mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
	as the phosphoprotein that associates with phospholipase C-gamma
	1 (PLC-gamma 1). Furthermore, following partial immunodepletion of
	GRB2 and of the associated pp36-38, there was a significant reduction
	in the amount of the 36-kDa phosphoprotein associated with PLC-gamma
	1, suggesting that a trimeric PLC-gamma 1/pp36-38/GRB2 complex could
	form. In support of this notion, we have also been able to detect
	low levels of PLC-gamma 1 in GRB2 immunoprecipitates. We suggest

  abstract = {The recently discovered 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1)
	is a serine/threonine protein kinase which phosphorylates several
	members of the conserved AGC kinase superfamily (comprising the prototypes

	a threonine or serine residue in the activation loop (also known

	in signaling pathways which regulate numerous important cellular
	processes including cellular survival, glucose transport and metabolism,
	tumor progression as well as protein translation. Moreover, the finding

	This kinase is most homologous to the Sterile 20 (Ste20) family of

	most similar to NIK in that they bind neither Cdc42 nor Rac and contain

	and C-terminal regulatory region of NIK are required for full activation
	of SAPK. NIK likely functions upstream of MEKK1 to activate this
	pathway; a dominant-negative MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) blocks activation
	of SAPK by NIK. MEKK1 and NIK also associate in cells and this interaction
	is mediated by regulatory domains on both proteins. Two other members

  abstract = {The IkappaB kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase/3-phosphoinositide-dependent
	protein kinase-1 (PDK1)/Akt pathways regulate various cellular functions,
	especially cell survival. These two pathways are often activated
	in many tumors and are thought to be associated with tumor progression.
	However, the cross-talk between them remains unclear. Here we show
	that PDK1 can activate IKK/NF-kappaB signaling in addition to Akt
	signaling to promote cell survival. Screening kinases that could
	modulate NF-kappaB activity revealed that expression of an upstream
	Akt kinase PDK1 up-regulates NF-kappaB transcriptional activity.
	We found that PDK1 directly phosphorylates IKKbeta at the Ser(181)
	residue in the activation loop, leading to NF-kappaB nuclear translocation
	and NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic gene expression. IKKalpha
	is not required for PDK1-mediated NF-kappaB activation because NF-kappaB
	activation was observed in IKKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast
	(MEF) cells as in wild type MEF cells. Akt, which was previously
	reported to activate IKKalpha, did not participate in the PDK1-dependent
	IKKbeta or NF-kappaB activation. The siRNA-mediated PDK1 gene silencing
	attenuated NF-kappaB activity and increased TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity.
	Moreover, expression of constitutively active IKKbeta overcame the
	PDK1 siRNA-mediated susceptibility to TRAIL. These results indicate
	that PDK1 is a critical regulator of cell survival by modulating
	the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway in addition to the Akt pathway.},

	for promoting recruitment of lipid rafts to the IS by an unknown

	whether Lck recruitment to the IS of human resting T cells depends

	that ultimately control the expression of genes essential for many

	we and others have recently observed that two members of the Rho
	family of small GTP-binding proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42, regulate the
	activity of JNKs. The identity of molecules communicating Rac1 and
	Cdc42 to JNK is still poorly understood. It has been suggested that
	Pak1 is the most upstream kinase connecting these GTPases to JNK;
	however, we have observed that coexpression of Pak1 with activated
	forms of Cdc42 or Rac1 diminishes rather than enhances JNK activation.
	This prompted us to explore the possibility that kinases other than
	Pak might participate in signaling from GTP-binding proteins to JNK.
	In this regard, a computer-assisted search for proteins containing
	areas of homology to that in Pak1 that is involved in binding to
	Rac1 and Cdc42 led to the identification of mixed lineage kinase
	3 (MLK3), also known as protein-tyrosine kinase 1, as a potential
	candidate for this function. In this study, we found that MLK3 overexpression
	is sufficient to activate JNK potently without affecting the phosphorylating
	activity of MAPK or p38. Furthermore, we present evidence that MLK3
	binds the GTP-binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac1 in vivo and that MLK3
	mediates activation of MEKK-SEK-JNK kinase cascade by Rac1 and Cdc42.
	Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that members of the
	novel MLK family of highly related kinases link small GTP-binding
	proteins to the JNK signaling pathway.},

  abstract = {Transendothelial migration of activated lymphocytes from the blood
	into the tissues is an essential step for immune functions. The housekeeping
	chemokine CXCL12 (or stroma cell-derived factor-1alpha), a highly
	efficient chemoattractant for T lymphocytes, drives lymphocytes to
	sites where they are highly likely to encounter antigens. This suggests
	that cross-talk between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CXCR4 (the
	CXCL12 receptor) might occur within these sites. Here we show that
	the zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70), a key element in TCR signaling,
	is required for CXCR4 signal transduction. The pharmacologic inhibition
	of ZAP-70, or the absence of ZAP-70 in Jurkat T cells and in primary
	CD4(+) T cells obtained from a patient with ZAP deficiency, resulted
	in an impairment of transendothelial migration that was rescued by
	the transfection of ZAP-70. Moreover, the overexpression of mutated
	forms of ZAP-70, whose kinase domain was inactivated, also abrogated
	the migratory response of Jurkat T cells to CXCL12. In contrast,
	no involvement of ZAP-70 in T-cell arrest on inflammatory endothelium
	under flow conditions or in CXCL12-induced actin polymerization was
	observed. Furthermore, CXCL12 induced time-dependent phosphorylation
	of ZAP-70, Vav1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs);
	the latter were reduced in the absence of functional ZAP-70. However,
	though a dominant-negative Vav1 mutant (Vav1 L213A) blocked CXCL12-induced
	T-cell migration, pharmacologic inhibition of the ERK pathway did
	not affect migration, suggesting that ERK activation is dispensable

  abstract = {Acute leukemias are believed to arise from unregulated proliferation
	of hematopoietic cells and loss of the ability to differentiate.
	Studies on the immunophenotypes of leukemic cells are very helpful
	for the understanding of antigen expression during normal hematopoiesis.
	CD7 antigen has until recently been considered to be a T-cell marker
	but has been found to be expressed by leukemic cells from some acute
	myeloid leukemia (CD7+ AML) and the normal putative counterparts
	of blasts from CD7+ AML can be found in human fetal livers. These
	double CD7 and myeloid antigen (CD13 and/or CD33) positive progenitors
	tend to lose their CD7 expression, while retaining their myeloid
	characteristics, after in vitro culture with the differentiation-inducing
	agent phorbol ester (TPA). This suggests that the cells are probably
	committed to the myeloid cell lineage and that CD7 is only transiently
	expressed in the early differentiation stage. On the other hand,
	there is a subset of CD7+ hematopoietic precursors which lack mature
	myeloid and T-cell antigens and have the potential to differentiate
	to both T-lymphoid and myeloid cells. These cells may in fact be
	the common myeloid-T lymphoid progenitors and represent the normal
	counterparts of acute undifferentiated leukemia or minimally differentiated
	T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

	by the protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45, activating Src family-related
	signaling pathways. Using purified recombinant phospho-Src (P-Src)
	(amino acid residues 83-533) and purified recombinant CD45 catalytic
	(cytoplasmic) domain (amino acid residues 565-1268), we have analyzed
	the kinetic behavior of dephosphorylation. A time course of phosphatase
	activity showed the presence of a burst phase. By varying the concentration
	of P-Src, it was shown that the amplitude of this burst phase increased
	linearly with respect to P-Src concentration. Approximately 2\% of
	P-Src was shown to be rapidly dephosphorylated followed by a slower
	linear phase. A P-Src protein substrate containing a functional point
	mutation in the Src homology domain 2 (SH2) led to more rapid dephosphorylation
	catalyzed by CD45, and this reaction showed only a single linear
	kinetic phase. These results were interpreted in terms of a model
	in which P-Src exists in a relatively slow dynamic equilibrium between
	"closed" and "open" conformational forms. Combined mutations in the
	SH2 and SH3 domain or the addition of an SH3 domain ligand peptide
	enhanced the accessibility of P-Src to CD45 by biasing P-Src to a
	more open form. Consistent with this model, a phosphotyrosine peptide
	that behaved as an SH2 domain binding ligand showed approximately
	100-fold greater affinity for unphosphorylated Src versus P-Src.
	Surprisingly, P-Src possessing combined SH3 and SH2 functional inactivating
	point mutations was dephosphorylated by CD45 more slowly compared
	with P-Src completely lacking SH3 and SH2 domains. Additional data
	suggest that the SH3 and SH2 domains can inhibit accessibility of
	the P-Src tail to CD45 by interactions other than direct phosphotyrosine
	binding by the SH2 domain. Taken together, these results suggest
	how activation of Src family member signaling pathways by CD45 may
	be influenced by the presence or absence of ligand interactions remote

	CD45RABC-D2 associated with Lck but, unlike its active counterpart
	CD45RABC, did not restore the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation

	This indicates that the non-catalytic domains of CD45 can interact

  abstract = {A key event in the regulation of the adaptive immune response is the
	binding of major histocompatibility complex-bound foreign peptides
	to T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) that are present on the cell surface
	of T lymphocytes. Recognition of the presence of cognate antigen
	in the host animal induces a series of biochemical changes within
	the T cell; these changes, in the context of additional signals from
	other surface receptors, ultimately result in massive proliferation
	of receptor-engaged T cells and the acquisition of effector and memory
	functions. Early studies established the importance of the activation
	of the enzymes phospholipase C-gamma1 (PLC-gamma1) and phosphatidylinositol
	3-kinase (PI3K), as well as the small molecular weight heterotrimeric
	guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) Ras, in this process.
	These biochemical events are dependent on the activity of several
	protein tyrosine kinases that become activated immediately upon TCR
	engagement. An unresolved question in the field has been which molecules
	and what sequence of events tie together the early tyrosine phosphorylation
	events with the activation of these downstream signaling molecules.
	A likely candidate for linking the proximal and distal portions of
	the TCR signaling pathway is the recently described protein, LAT.
	LAT is a 36-kD transmembrane protein that becomes rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated
	after TCR engagement. Phosphorylation of LAT creates binding sites
	for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of other proteins, including
	PLC-gamma1, Grb2, Gads, Grap, 3BP2, and Shb, and indirectly binds
	SOS, c-Cbl, Vav, SLP-76, and Itk. LAT is localized to the glycolipid-enriched
	membrane (GEM) subdomains of the plasma membrane by virtue of palmitoylation
	of two cysteine residues positioned near the endofacial side of the
	plasma membrane. Notably, in the absence of LAT, TCR engagement does
	not lead to activation of distal signaling events. This review examines
	the circumstances surrounding the discovery of LAT and our current
	understanding of its properties, and discusses current models for
	how LAT may be functioning to support the transduction of TCR-initiated,
	T cell-specific signaling events to the distal, general signaling
	machinery.},

	synapse during T cell activation, although the molecular consequences
	of CD45 repositioning remain unclear. In this study we examine the
	role of CD45 membrane compartmentalization in regulating murine T
	cell activation. We find that raft-localized CD45 antagonizes IL-2
	production by opposing processive TCR signals, whereas raft-excluded
	CD45 promotes ERK-dependent polarized synaptic lipid raft clustering
	and IL-2 production. We propose that these dual CD45 activities ensure
	that only robust TCR signals proceed, whereas signals meeting threshold
	requirements are potentiated. Our findings highlight membrane compartmentalization
	as a key regulator of CD45 function and elucidate a novel signal
	transduction pathway by which raft-excluded CD45 positively regulates
	T cell activation.},

  abstract = {The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is activated in response
	to many stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, environmental
	stresses and, in the case of B and T lymphocytes, by antigenic stimulation.
	Bcl10 is essential for NF-kappaB activation by T- and B-cell receptors.
	T and B lymphocytes from Bcl10-deficient mice fail to activate NF-kappaB
	in response to antigen-receptor stimulation and, as a consequence,
	are unable to proliferate. Bcl10 overexpression is sufficient to
	activate NF-kappaB, a process that requires the NF-kappaB essential
	modulator NEMO (also known as IKK-gamma), which is the regulatory
	subunit of the IkappaB kinase complex. However, the cellular mechanism
	by which Bcl10 activates the NF-kappaB pathway remains unclear. Here
	we show that Bcl10 targets NEMO for lysine-63-linked ubiquitination.
	Notably, a mutant form of NEMO that cannot be ubiquitinated inhibited
	Bcl10-induced NF-kappaB activation. Paracaspase and a ubiquitin-conjugating
	enzyme (UBC13) were both required for Bcl10-induced NEMO ubiquitination
	and subsequent NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, short interfering
	RNAs that reduced the expression of paracaspase and UBC13 abrogated
	the effects of Bcl10. Thus, the adaptor protein Bcl10 promotes activation
	of NF-kappaB transcription factors through paracaspase- and UBC13-dependent
	ubiquitination of NEMO.},

   abstract = "Analysis of knockout mice and of T cells deficient for individual signaling proteins allowed the identification of novel members of the costimulation-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway while biochemical approaches started to unveil their functional mechanisms. These results show that NF-kappaB activation depends on an early wave of tyrosine phosphorylation that allows the inducible formation of multiprotein complexes containing several proteins required for NF-kappaB activation: adaptor proteins including Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte phosphoprotein 76 (SLP-76) and proteins with enzymatic activity, such as phospholipase C (PLC) gamma and the exchange factor Vav1. While Vav1 contributes to Rac-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, activated PLCgamma1 generates the protein kinase C (PKC) activator diacylglycerol. In T cells, the novel PKC isoform PKCtheta is indispensable for NF-kappaB activation and its enzymatic activity depends on recruitment to the immunological synapse. Downstream from PKCtheta, the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) proteins CARD11/CARMA1 and Bcl10 relay T cell receptor-derived signals to the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. Many members of the NF-kappaB activation cascade, including the IKKs, are either constitutively or inducibly translocated to the lipid raft fraction, showing a highly organized spatial distribution of these NF-kappaB activating proteins."
