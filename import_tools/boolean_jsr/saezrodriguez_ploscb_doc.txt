R | 1|       --> cd28 |1| Binding of ligand or antibody to cd28 is an input of the model. 
R | 2|       --> cd4  |1| Binding of ligand or antibody to cd4 is an input of the model. 
R | 3|     --> tcrlig |1| Binding of ligand or antibody to the tcr is an input of the model. 
R | 4| !bad --> bclxl               |1| bad inhibits bclxl\cite{zha:1997,yang:1995}. 
R | 5| !cabin + !calpr + !akap7 + cam --> calcin  |1|  cam binds to and activates calcineurin (calcin), while  cabin1, calpr1, akap79 inhibit calcin\cite{Matsuda_EMBO_2000,ryeom:2003,Kashishian_JBC_1998}. 
R | 6| !camk4 --> cabin1                              |1| camk4 regulates via phosphorylation nuclear export of Cabin1\cite{pan:2005}. 
R | 7| card11a + pkcth --> ikkg  |1| The complex card1 +bcl10 +malt1 is required for ikkg activation \cite{Thome_NatRevImm_2004,weil:2006,MatthewS}. Phosphorylation, probably via pkcth\cite{khoshnan:2000}, is also required.
R | 8| !ccblp1 + tcrlig --> tcrb  |1| Binding        of ligand activates the tcr, while active ccbl ubiquinates it, thus        leading to tcr degradation\cite{Huang_JBC_04}. 
R | 9| !ccblp1 + tcrp + abl --> zap70            |1| abl phosphorylates and thus activates zap70\cite{ZipfelPA_CurrBiol_04} once it is bound to the tcr. Active ccbl can degrade zap70. 
R | 10| !cd28 --> cblb               |2| cd28 induces cblb ubiquitination and degradation\cite{ZhangJ_JImm_02} after the early events thus, &tau;=2. 
R | 11| !dg + plcga --> dag |1| The active form of plc &gamma; 1 (plcga) splits pip2 into diacylglycerol (dag) and ip3 (see hyperarc 83)\cite{Huang_JBC_04}. Active dgks degrade dag into phosphatic acid\cite{TophamMK_JCB_06}. 
R | 12| !er + lckp1 --> shp1                           |2| lck phosphorylates shp1 leading to its activation which allows it to dephosphorylate and thus deactivate lck. erk phosphorylates lck at p59, protecting it from shp1's effect\cite{StefanovaI_Nature_02,Altan-Bonnet_PLoSBiol_05}. Since shp1 activation comes some time after lck activation, it takes place at &tau;=2. 
R | 13| !gab2 + zap70 + gads --> slp76        |1| slp76 associates with lat via gads\cite{HorejsiV_NatRevImm_04,TogniM_MolImm_04}. gab2 competes for binding, and thus inhibits binding of slp76 to gads\cite{yamasaki:2001,yamasaki:2003}. 
R | 14| !gsk3 --> bcat                              |1| Gsk3 inhibits bcat\cite{Liang_CC_03}. 
R | 15| !gsk3 --> cyc1                       |1| Gsk3 inhibits cyc1\cite{Liang_CC_03}. 
R | 16| !ikb --> nfkb                      |1| nfkb is retained in the cytoplasm by tight binding to the inhibitory protein ikb\cite{Huang_JBC_04}. 
R | 17| !ikkab --> ikb               |1| ikb is phosphorylated by ikkab, leading to its ubiquination and subsequent degradation\cite{Huang_JBC_04,Krauss}. 
R | 18| ikk + camk2 --> ikkab           |1|        Both the regulatory molecule ikkg and phosphorylation probably (but not only) via camk2 are required for the activation of the kinase subunits ikkalpha and beta (ikkab)\cite{Thome_NatRevImm_2004,weil:2006,MatthewS}. 
R | 19| !pkb --> bad              |1| pkb inhibits bad\cite{hanada:2004}. 
R | 20| !pkb --> fkhr             |1| pkb inhibits fkhr\cite{hanada:2004}. 
R | 21| !pkb --> gsk3        |1| pkb inhibits gsk3 \cite{Liang_CC_03,hanada:2004}. 
R | 22| !pkb --> p21c        |1| pkb inhibits p21c \cite{Liang_CC_03,hanada:2004}. 
R | 23| !pkb --> p27k          |1| pkb inhibits p27k \cite{Liang_CC_03,hanada:2004}. 
R | 24| !gadd4 + zap70 --> p38          |1|        gadd45 inhibits the zap70 mediated activation of p38\cite{SalvadorJM_NatImmunol_05}. 
R | 25| !shp + cd4 + cd + !cs + lckr --> lckp1  |1| Full activation of the cd4-bound pool (there is also a tcr-dependent pool, see hyperarc 62/64 and legend) of lck requires dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory site (by cd45, and in absence of csk, which phosphorylates it) and autophosphorylation of the positive regulatory site, which cd4-bound lck can perform upon cd4 crosslinking\cite{PalaciosEH_Onco_04}. 
R | 26| !tcrb --> pag                               |1| upon ligand binding to the tcr, pag is dephosphorylated by an unidentified phosphatase (probably cd45)\cite{DavidsonD_MCB_03}. 
R | 27| ap1 -->                                     |1| the transcription factor ap1 is an output of the model. 
R | 28| bcat -->                            |1| bcat is an output of the model. 
R | 29| bclxl -->                                     |1| bclx is an output of the model. 
R | 30| ca --> cam                    |1| calcium binds to calmodulin and this complex to calcineurin\cite{Feske_NI_2001}. 
R | 31| calcin --> nfat                        |1| calcineurin dephosphorylates nfat leading to  nuclear translocation and activation of nfat\cite{Huang_JBC_04,macian:2005,Krauss}.
R | 32| cam --> camk4             |1| camk2 activation is dependent on calmodulin (cam)\cite{Anderson_Biometals_1998}. 
R | 33| ccblr + fyn --> ccblp2                  |2| Upon Fyn phosphorylation, ccbl can inhibit  plcg\cite{Rellahan_ECR_03}. This is one out of 2 mechanisms ccbl is        involved in, and we call it ccblp2 (pool 2, see legend). Since ccbl mediated inhibition is slower than the early events, &tau;=2. 
R | 34| ccblr + zap70 --> ccblp1  |2| ccbl binds to activated (and thus phosphorylated) zap70, leading to the ubiquination and subsequent degradation of zap70 and tcr\cite{RaoN_JImm_00}.  This is one out of 2 mechanisms ccbl is involved in, and we call it ccblp1 (pool 1, see legend). Since ccbl mediated degradation has to be slower than the early events, &tau;=2. 
R | 35| x --> vav1                   |1| CD28 stimulation leads to Vav1 activation\cite{MichelF_Jimmunol_00,Raab2001,HehnerSP_JBC_00,Kovacs2005}, a process mediated by a yet unidentified kinase (see hyperarc 48). 
R | 36| cdc42 --> mekk1              |1| The GTP         bound cdc42 (and rac1, see hyperarc 87) is able to bind mekk1\cite{FangerGR_EMBO_1997}; CD28 activates mekk1  in a  cdc42 mediated manner\cite{Kaga_JI_1998}. 
R | 37| cre -->                            |1| cre is an output of the model. 
R | 38| creb --> cre                         |1| The creb protein is a transcription factor that binds to cre ativating the related genes\cite{Krauss}. 
R | 39| cyc1 -->                               |1| cyc1 is an output of the model, and is involved in  cell cycle regulation\cite{Krauss}. 
R | 40| dag --> rasgrp  |1| dag causes the cytoplasmic rasgrp1 to move to the golgi, where it can act on Golgi associated-ras\cite{DiFiore_Nature_03,BivonaTG_Nature_03}. Even though pkcth phosphorylates rasgrp at t184,\cite{RooseJP_MCB_05} we did not include  connection pkcth  -->  rasgrp1 since this effect is not specific to pkcth, but general to other pkcs (less well-characterized in T cells and therefore not included in the model); inclusion of this effect would make this step strictly dependent on pkcth, which is not the case. 
R | 41| da + vav + pdk1 --> pkcth                 |1| Activation of pkcth requires binding to dag, phosphorylation by pdk1\cite{LeeKY_Science_05}, and vav1\cite{VillalbaM_JCB_02}. 
R | 42| erk --> fos                                 |1| erk phosphorylates fos\cite{Huang_JBC_04}.

R | 47| fyn --> pag                               |2| fyn phosphorylates pag\cite{DavidsonD_MCB_03}, leading to the binding of csk. This process takes place 3-5 min after tcr activation, and thus it belongs to the time scale &tau;=2\cite{TorgersenKM_JBC_01}. \\ \hline 
R | 48| cd28 --> x                                |1| Vav1 activation requires cd28 activation\cite{MichelF_Jimmunol_00,Raab2001,Kovacs2005} and is mediated by an non-identified kinase x (see hyperarcs 35 and 63). 
R | 49| gab2 --> shp2                                |1| Gab2 recruits shp2\cite{arnaud:2004}. 
R | 50| gad + la + zap70 --> gab2                   |2| zap70 phosphorylates gab2 upon binding to lat and gads\cite{yamasaki:2001,yamasaki:2003}.  This process must take place after the early events to allow signal propagation, thus &tau;=2. 
R | 51| grb + la + zap70 --> gab2                  |2| zap70 phosphorylates gab2 upon binding to lat and grb2\cite{yamasaki:2001,yamasaki:2003}. This process must take place after the early events to allow signal propagation, thus &tau;=2. 
R | 52| hpk1 --> mekk1                           |1| hpk1 binds and phosphorylates mekk1\cite{HuMC_GDev_96}. 
R | 53| hpk1 --> mlk3                            |1| hpk1 binds and phosphorylates mlk3\cite{Tibbles_EMBO_1996}. 
R | 54| ip3 --> ca                                 |1| Binding of ip3 to the ip3 receptor in the endoplasmatic reticulum leads to the release of calcium\cite{Chan_ARB_1999}.

R | 56| lat --> grb2                     |1| grb2        (which in turn binds sos) can bind to phosphorylated lat\cite{LindquistJA_ImmRev_03}\cite{HorejsiV_NatRevImm_04}. 
R | 57| lat --> hpk1                              |1| hpk1 binds to lat and is recruited to the lipid raftss\cite{LiouJ_Immunity_00}. 
R | 58| lat --> plcgb                                |1| plcgamma binds to lat\cite{HorejsiV_NatRevImm_04,TogniM_MolImm_04}. 
R | 59| lckp1 --> abl            |1| abl kinases        are activated following tcr stimulation via a Src kinase (lck or fyn,        see hyperarc 46)\cite{ZipfelPA_CurrBiol_04}. 
R | 60| lckp1 --> rlk                                |1| lck phosphorylates rlk leading to its activation\cite{ShanX_MCB_00}. 
R | 61| lckp + cd45 --> fyn                       |1| lck activates fyn\cite{FilippD_JImm_04}, a process where the        dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory site of fyn by cd45 is also required. 
R | 62| lckp + !cblb --> pi3k                     |1| pi3k is dependent on the Src kinase lck for activation\cite{DeaneJA_AnnRevImmunol_04}. Additionally, cblb promotes pi3k ubiquination\cite{FangD_NatImmunol_01}. 
R | 63| x + !cblb --> pi3k                      |1|  pi3k is also activated upon CD28\cite{august:1994,ghiotto_ragueneau:1996}  via an non-determined kinase x (see hyperarc 48). Even though Lck has been proposed to be involved in this process\cite{vonWillebrandM_EJI_94,GibsonS_BiochemJ_98,holdorf:1999,huang:2002}, our experiments show that, at least for primary human T-cells, PI3K activation is not strictly Src-kinase dependent (see Fig. S4). A reasonable candidate would be a Tec kinase, but since it is not experimentally verified, we keep an undetermined x.  \\ \hline 
R | 64| lck + tcrb --> lckp2 |1| The activation        of pi3k is determined by a second pool of lck (lckp2) (see legend) which can be activated by tcr activation\cite{OkkenhaugK_NatRevImmunol_03}. 
R | 65| malt1 + card11 + bcl10 --> card11a                |1| The binding of  malt1 to card11 and bcl10 forms the active card11 complex\cite{Thome_NatRevImm_2004,Gaide_NI_2002, Uren_MolCell_2000, Lucas_JBC_2001}.

R | 77| pag --> csk        |1| Phosphorylation of pag allows csk to bind it and then act on lck\cite{LindquistJA_ImmRev_03,HorejsiV_NatRevImm_04}.  
R | 78| pdk1 --> p70s      |1| pkd1 phosphorylates p70s leading to its activation\cite{pullen:1998,hinton:2004}. 
R | 79| pdk1 --> pkb                    |1| pdk1 phosphorylates pkb leading to its activation\cite{LafontV_FEBSletters_00,alessi:1997,anderson:1998}.

R | 81| pip3 --> pdk1          |1| pip3 is required for pdk1 activation\cite{ mora:2004}. 
R | 82| pip + zap7 + slp76 --> itk    |1| When phosphorylated, slp76 can bind to itk; additional binding to pip3 and phosphorylation via zap70 activates itk\cite{Huang_JBC_04,TogniM_MolImm_04,CzarMJ_BiochemSocTran_01}. 
R | 83| plcga --> ip3                |1| Active plcga splits pip2 into ip3 and diacylglycerol (dag,see hyperarc 11)\cite{Huang_JBC_04,TogniM_MolImm_04}. 
R | 84| plcg + !ccblp + slp7 + zap7 + vav + itk --> plcga  |1| Once bound to phosphorylated lat, plcgb is activated by the combined action of vav and itk (or rlk, see hyperarc 85)\cite{CzarMJ_BiochemSocTran_01}. Additionally, binding to slp76 (phosphorylated by zap70)  is required to establish and stabilize the complex. Activated ccbl degrades plcga\cite{Rellahan_ECR_03}. 
R | 85| plcg + !ccblp + zap7 + vav + slp7 + rlk        --> plcga  |1| Once bound to phosphorylated lat,        plcgb is activated by the combined action of vav and rlk (or itk, see hyperarc 84)\cite{CzarMJ_BiochemSocTran_01}.

R | 88| rac1p2 --> sre   |1| Vav3-dependent Rac1 is able to activate Sre via SRF\cite{hill:1995}. 
R | 89| rac1 + vav1 --> rac1p1 |1| Downregulation of Vav1 but not Vav3 affects IL-2 production in T cells\cite{zakaria:2004} via the rac1-mediated jnk pathway.  Since rac1 mediates this process, we defined a vav1-dependent pool of rac1 (see hyperarc 90 and legend).
R | 90| rac1 + vav3 --> rac1p2          |1| Downregulation of Vav3 but not Vav1 affects Sre activity\cite{zakaria:2004}. Since rac1 mediates this process, we defined a vav3-dependent pool of rac1 (see hyperarc 89 and legend)

R | 95| so + !ga + rasgrp --> ras  |1| Bound to lat via grb2, sos catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP in the cellular-membrane-located ras, while rasgrp1 catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP in golgi-located ras\cite{DiFiore_Nature_03}.

R | 98| tcr + fyn --> tcrp             |1| Upon ligand binding to the tcr, active fyn can phosphorylate the tcr\cite{FilippD_MolImm_04}. 
R | 99| tcr + lckp1 --> tcrp               |1|        The  co-localization of tcr with cd4 mediated by peptide-MHC or        antibody crosslinking results in an increased local concentration of lck around the tcr leading to phosphorylation of ITAMs\cite{FilippD_JImm_04}.

Since lck is required in the development for having capable fyn\cite{ZamoyskaR_ImmunolRev_03}, lckr (existence of lck in the cell) is required as well.

R | 103| zap7 + sh3bp2 --> vav1             |1| zap70 phosphorylates vav1\cite{zakaria:2004} which together with binding of vav1 to sh3bp2\cite{Qu_Biochem_05}, leads to vav1 activation. 
R | 104|--> card11 |1| Regulation of card11 is not clear, thus we set an external input to it. Default value is 1.
