== SBWiki maintenance scripts ==

These maintenance scripts are designed to be run in-place -- no need to copy
them to your main MediaWiki maintenance directory.  Scripts can be run with a
command line PHP call if your MediaWiki is properly configured to run
maintenance scripts (i.e. AdminSettings.php is configured).
